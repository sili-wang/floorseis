This is code for footstep count and trajectory tracking with vibration sensor network.

Morphology-segmentation-footstep count.ipynb shows how morphological algorithm achieve footstep count.

The Morphology-trajectory.ipynb shows a 4-nodes trajectory tracking demo. To run this code, you need to down load the 4 csv file in this folder. These 4 files are the raw data from 4 nodes respectively.

We also have a video to show the demo:
